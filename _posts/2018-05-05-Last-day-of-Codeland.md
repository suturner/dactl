<h2>Last day of Codeland</h2>
<p>Today, was not as great as yesterday.  More amazing speakers with great ideas, but I realized I am no closer to realizing my next steps on my coding journey.</p>
<p>I know I want to build something, but the question is what do I build.  I’m sure I’m being hella dramatic about it, but how can you not be?  Even though the point maybe to learn how to code not to focus on being the best coder.</p>
<p>So the important things… What were the tasks for today?  Since I’m still not sure how much of the code I need to type into the terminal to get my browser to operate like a local server, I looked up the definition of localhost and did a bit of reading on that, watched a couple of videos on Git, then I looked up the documentation on Jekyll to figure out how to start taking this website apart.  It looks like it has a lot less moving parts than Wordpress.  Too tired to do anymore than that.</p>
<p>Lessons learned: Sleep is important, if you want to learn anything or be pleasant.</p>
