<h1>Born again coder in Codeland</h1>
<p>Today has been the funniest day, so far, on my coding journey.   I’m at a conference for brand new coders or seasoned coders who don’t need to beat each other over the head with how brilliant they are and I sign up for a workshop on how to create a technical blog, because I’m a coder who doesn’t know how to code.  I don’t want to go to anything technical.  I want to see what I want to learn and cherry pick the good parts of coding and leaving the hard boring coding crap for the folks that like that stuff.  I’m here for the glory.  What do I sign up for?  Technical blogging with Jekyll.  Why did I think Jekyll was the name of the chick giving the talk?  Like Late night with Letterman…</p>
<p>Duh!  Again.  I’m a coder who doesn’t know how to code.  Why would I know this?  So immediately the moderator gets into Git hub, some Ruby and Jekyll and I realize…  We aren’t talking about the superficial ish of idea generation and web syntax, not even a little “marketing the site” bs or even showing other great examples of technical blogs. No, I am sitting there wonder why are we talking about programs?  Why her name isn’t Jekyll? I realize, I’m in the wrong room. This is some technical ish.</p>
<p>So, a funny thing happened on the way to the conference.  Maybe 2 weeks ago, I got sick and tired of my computer refusing to upgrade to the new Mac OS claiming not enough room.  So I fixed it.  2 weeks ago, I deleted a bunch of useless ish that was clogging my storage drives and not helping me live.  I was tired of it and I was just a deleting machine.  Ended up freeing about 50 gigs of space…  The fact that it was that much should have tipped me off, but I’m a coder who doesn’t know how to code.  Little did I know that 2 weeks later I would be in a workshop trying to install Jekyll with a chick named Powell that I would need that little program called Xcode.  Who would have thunk something taking up so much space would be useful?  So I spend my entire workshop period laughing at the wannabe coder that’s me while my computer reloads all those programs.  I can’t make this ish up.</p>
<p>Lessoned learned:  Don’t be afraid to delete ish. You can always reload.</p>
